### Hi :v::smile:

My name is Isa, and I am a software developer kicking it on the East Coast, USA. Below, you can see some of the projects that I've built in my pinned repositories section.

Recently, I had the opportunity to complete a mentorship program at [The Collab Lab](https://the-collab-lab.codes) where I was a member of a distributed software development team for 8 weeks, building a shopping list [app](https://lettuce-know.web.app). It was a new experience, mainly because our team had to _really_ be on top of commmunicating well with each other, especially since this was a 100% remote project. I gained a new level of understanding on how to collaborate with GitHub, create pull requests, write helpful code reviews, and merge branches to main. I know I still have a lot to learn on my journey as a software developer â€” and that's part of why I love this industry â€” but at the same time, I feel very confident that I could fit well on any software development team that has a culture of collaboration and respect. 

Here are some of my skills that represent the tools and frameworks I've worked with to build projects. :point_down:

- [x] JavaScript
- [x] HTML, CSS
- [x] React.js
- [x] Node.js
- [x] Express.js
- [x] MongoDB
- [x] Mongoose
- [x] Firebase
- [x] Material-UI

My hope as a software developer is to be able to contribute something meaningful and helpful to others. As I gain more experience and knowledge, I would really like to help educate others on how they can start their own journey in tech. You can learn more about me here:
